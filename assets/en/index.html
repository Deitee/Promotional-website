				<h2>Will you succeed in taking power?</h2>
				<p>Welcome to the most famous cowboy town in Westown, the landmark of the biggest cowboys and robbers in the FarWest. While a town is looking for a new sheriff, you offer yourself for the job and compete with another aspiring sheriff for the same role. Dueling, drinking contests, horse
                    racing, dancing, archery, escape, players will compete to win the favours of the seven characters by collecting items that represent their performances. Thanks to thoughtful anticipation and bold decisions, you can win the essential objects while leaving out the less interesting ones.</p>

				<h2>How to play ?</h2>
				<p>How do you beat your opponent and become the next Sheriff of Westown? It's very simple! In the game, you will find 7 characters emblematic of a western. From the barber with this cabbage patch to the banker obsessed with money, they are very different characters, but they all carry a certain weight in the town. Your mission is to seduce them to get elected sheriff. To win the favour of these citizens, you should offer them as many items as possible. These objects are precious goods for them, like the barman with his mug. Beware! You will probably have to make choices and sacrifice some characters at the expense of others. It's a fierce competition coming up, where the new sheriff will be the one who has managed to win the favours of 4 characters or collect 11 points.</p>
